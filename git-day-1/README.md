a) How many commits are there in this project?
b) What is the title of the second commit?
c) What is the hash for the first commit in the history?

## Getting a local repository

### Pairs

- Get a local copy of a repository on your local machine. Open the files and folders of your copy on your local machine.


## Creating a commit

### Pairs
### ⏲️ ( 15 mins )

Go to your files and folders in the repository. Now answer the question in line 10 on the Github repository. Save the file.

Tip: You can use CMD + S to save changes to a file in VSCode.


## Checking out the changes

### Pairs
### ⏲️ ( 15 mins )

You've got a git commit.
You can check out the changes on your local machine.
Go to the **Source Control** tab on your local machine.

📝 Double-check how many commits you have locally.

> 🎯 Goal: Make some **local** changes and create a **local commit**.


To create a commit, we need to c

1. Go to the **Source Control** tab in VSCode.
2. Go to the Changes section and look at the changes for the file.


## Staging changes

### Pairs
### ⏲️ ( 15 mins )


To create a commit, we need to tell Git the changes we want to include in the next commit.
So if we change a file, we need to **stage** this changed file.

Let's put the changed file into the **staging area**.

1. Go to the file `README.md` and click on the **+**.

Notice what happens when you carry out step 1.

2. View the Staged Changes area in your Source Control panel.

## 📸 Creating the commit

### ⏲️ ( 15 mins )


Once we've staged changes, then we can **commit** these changes.

📝 Check the number of commits you have locally. They should still be the same as before.

1. Enter a commit message describing briefly what you did in your commit.
2. Click Commit to create the Git commit.

📝  Now re-check the number of commits you have locally.


Once you've completed this **commit**, you can swap roles in your pair.
