# Welcome to CYF Workshops

This is a shared repository of workshops developed by CYF volunteers. All these workshops are open source and free to use. Workshops are group activities generally run on CYF class days, or sometimes in midweek sessions.

Some of these workshops are shown on the [CYF curriculum site](https://curriculum.codeyourfuture.io) day plans. Others are used in other contexts. All are welcome!

## How to contribute

Report issues by opening a ticket on this repo. If you are talking about a specific workshop, please include the name of the workshop in the title of the ticket and @mention the author of the workshop in the body of the ticket. There's no guarantee the author is still around!

To contribute a workshop, open a pull request and label it [New Workshop]. There's a template folder with some helpful notes.

Please only submit workshops you actually plan to use in a currently running cohort (or have run in a past CYF cohort).

## Deployments

This entire repo is deployed to Netlify, so any index.html you upload to your folder will create a webpage you can use in your workshop.

Pull requests will automatically generate disposable branch previews and a bot will link these on the PR. This will work for trainees if that is useful for your activity.
