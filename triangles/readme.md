## Learning objectives

```objectives
- [ ] Formulate requirements from a problem statement
- [ ] Set out some acceptance criteria
- [ ] Specify some test cases
- [ ] Implement a function based off some test cases
- [ ] Interpret documentation on JavaScript logical operators
```

## ðŸ§° Setup


## Context

Let's begin by getting some context about this problem.

Use this page ðŸ‘‰ https://www.mathsisfun.com/triangle.html to get the names of different triangles depending on their three side lengths.
There are three different names: make sure you're familiar with these.

## Interpret requirements

In this workshop, you'll need to implement a function that takes **the three side lengths of a triangle** and returns a string indicating whether it is **`"equilateral"`**, **`"isoceles"`** or **`"scalene"`**


## Acceptance criteria
 
First off, you'll need to name the function based off the requirements. The name should clearly convey what the function does.
Then you'll need to set out acceptance criteria for this function in the form:

_Given_ ...
_When_ ...
_Then_ ...

## ðŸ§ª Write your first assertion

Write your first assertion using `console.assert` to check the functionality.
