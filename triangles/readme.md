# Classify triangles

## objectives

```objectives

- [ ] Interpret requirements from 
- [ ] Set out some acceptance criteria
- [ ] Specify some test cases
- [ ] Implement a function based off some test cases
 
```

Check out the link to this page giving information about different types of triangles https://www.mathsisfun.com/triangle.htm
The link tells you how to classify triangles based on their 3 sides

## Interpret requirements

In this workshop, you'll need to implement a function that takes **the three side lengths of a triangle** and returns a string indicating whether it is **`"equilateral"`**, **`"isoceles"`** or **`"scalene"`**

You will need to do the following:

## Acceptance criteria

First off, you'll need to come up with a name for this function based off the requirements.
Then you'll need to set out an acceptance criterion for this function in the form👍

_Given_ ...
_When_ ...
_Then_ ...

## 🧪 Write your first assertion

Write your first assertion using `console.assert` to check the functionality.
