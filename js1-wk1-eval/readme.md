# JS1 week 1 evaluation

## Instructions

The aim of this workshop is to check your understanding.

Each task will explain whether or not you should run the code.

For each task, you can use https://curriculum.codeyourfuture.io/js1/sprints/1/prep/
to help you with the questions
You can also use documentation to look up any functions that are unfamiliar
Don't use ChatGPT or any other AI tool to help you.

## Evaluate

After each task, use the poll to give your feedback on how you found the task.
Be as honest as possible.
Try your best - if you don't understand then this is still useful feedback.

Here is how you can categorise the task:

- Knew what to do straight away
- Made sense after checking the docs
- Made sense after support from volunteers
- Partially understood - but still not confident
- Had no idea what to do
