# Asking Questions 101

1. What I _did_
1. What I _expected_
1. What _happened_

When we are surprised by an outcome it means we had a mental model of the world that didn't predict it accurately. To develop our understanding of coding, we:

1. Build a model in our mind (a "mental model")
1. Play computer - "run" the model and _predict_ (say before) what the outcome will be
1. Code our model
1. Run the code

When we ask questions, we need to share this frame with others so together we can test the right thing. Let's look at an example.
