# Workshop Name

Replace this readme with the requirements for your workshop

## Learning Objectives

```objectives
- [ ] Use the Teach Tech Together guide to construct your objectives
- [ ] Limit the objectives to 3-5 items
- [ ] Write objectives you can measure
```

## Requirements

Explain the requirements of the workshop. You might want to talk about goals here. You might want to use formal specifications like Given/When/Then. It's ok for requirements to be in different formats. We want trainees to learn to interpret requirements in many settings and expressions. Just make sure your workshop is active and not a lecture.

Always write your workshop in a readme.md in a folder with the same name as the workshop. This makes it easy to find and easy to show on the curriculum website.

## Acceptance Criteria

- I have provided clear success criteria
- These might be related to the objectives and the requirements
- I have given some simple, clear ways for trainees to evaluate their work
- I have run Lighthouse and my Accessibility score is 100
