# Staging changes


## Learning objectives

- [ ] stage changes in our working directory
- [ ] check the state of the working directory and the staging area


## Updating the working tree

Let's make a change to the current working directory and then stage that change.


### Steps ðŸ‘£

1. Open up this project in VSCode (if you've not done so already).
2. Go to `examples/ex-1.js` and try the first exercise in there

You will have made a change to the **working tree**.

3. Once you've updated `examples/ex-1.js` go to the Version Control tab in VSCode and double-check you can see your change to the Working Tree.


## Staging area ðŸ”´ðŸŸ¢

We need to tell Git which changes we want to include in our next commit.

We do this by promoting these changes files to the **staging area**.

ðŸ”‘ **Staging area** is the space to prepare (stage) the changes that will be in the next commit.


### Steps ðŸ‘£

1. Use `git status` command to check the state of your **Working Tree** and your **Staging Area**. What does `git status` tell you?
2. Now **stage** this change using the `git add` command to stage your change to `exercises/ex-1.js`
3. Once again, after you've done this - check the status of the **Working Tree** and the **Staging Area**.
