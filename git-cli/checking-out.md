ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Checkout a new branch using the Git CLI

Let's remind ourselves what the commit history looks like:

## Steps ðŸ‘£

1. Let's start by double checking which branch we're on. Find a Git CLI command to double check the branch you're currently on.

We need to create a **branch** so we can start making changes independently from `main`. We'll need an appropriate branch name for the changes.

We can use the command `git checkout` command.

Use the `git checkout` command to create a new branch.

Now double-check you're on the branch you just created.
