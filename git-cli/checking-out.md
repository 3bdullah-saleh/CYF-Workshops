# Checking out ðŸŒ´

ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Checkout a new branch using the Git CLI

Let's remind ourselves what the commit history looks like:

![git-log-output](./assets/git-log-output.png)


## Steps ðŸ‘£

Let's start by using `git log`.

Run the command `git log` in your `bbc-food` directory.

We need to create a **branch** so we can start making changes independently from `main`. We'll need an appropriate branch name for the changes.

Now run the command `git checkout -b {YOUR_BRANCH_NAME}`

Now run `git log --oneline` and _check_ the branch was created successfully.
