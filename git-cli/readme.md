This workshop serves several overarching _themes_:


At the moment, you're using the VSCode interface to interact with Git.


You can use the version control Tab to view changes
- Develop our **mental model** of staging and committing in Git
- Consolidate existing knowledge of Git
- Develop use of your CLI skills for Git


## Learning objectives

During this session, you will:

```objectives
- [ ] Research essential git cli commands for creating a commit
- [ ] Create a new branch using the git CLI
- [ ] Switch between branches in a Git project using Git CLI
- [ ] Stage changes using Git CLI
- [ ] Inspect the working directory and staging area using the Git CLI
- [ ] Commit staged changes using the Git CLI
```

## Setup

You'll need to work on this workshop in pairs.

- Assign one person to be **driver** (the driver will control the keyboard and do the typing)
- Assign another person to be **navigator** (the navigator will read out the questions and suggest how to tackle the problems)
- The **driver** will need to ensure they have a clone of this repo on their local machine **clone** this repository to their local machine.


## Task

In pairs, you will practice Git CLI commands to complete the tasks in this workshop.
After each commit, you should swap roles
