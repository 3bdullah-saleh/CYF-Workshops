## Purpose

Currently, you're using the ðŸŽ® VSCode **interface** to interact with Git.
However, we can often use different **interfaces** to carry out the same tasks.

In this workshop, you will use the Git CLI - Command Line **Interface** to interact with Git.
In addition, you will:

- Consolidate existing knowledge of Git
- Develop your **mental model** of the working tree and the staging area
- Learn to use basic Git CLI skills


## Learning objectives

During this session, with the Git CLI, you will:

```objectives
- [ ] Research essential git commands commands for creating a commit
- [ ] Inspect the status of the working directory and staging area
- [ ] Checkout a new branch
- [ ] Add changes from the working tree to the staging area
- [ ] Commit staged changes
```

## Setup

You'll need to work on this workshop in pairs.

- Assign one person to be **driver** (the driver will control the keyboard and do the typing)
- Assign another person to be **navigator** (the navigator will read out the questions and suggest how to tackle the problems)
- The **driver** will need to ensure they have a clone of this repo on their local machine **clone** this repository to their local machine.


## Task

In pairs, you will practice Git CLI commands to complete the tasks in this workshop.
After each commit, you should swap roles
