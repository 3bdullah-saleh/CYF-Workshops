## Purpose

Currently, you're using the ðŸŽ® VSCode **interface** to interact with Git.
However, as with many things in software, we can often use different interface to carry out the same tasks.

In this workshop, you will use the Git CLI - Command Line **Interface** to interact with Git. In addition, you will:

- Consolidate existing knowledge of Git
- Develop your **mental model** of the working tree and the staging area
- Learn to use basic Git CLI skills


## Learning objectives

During this session, you will:

```objectives
- [ ] Research essential git cli commands for creating a commit
- [ ] Create a new branch using the git CLI
- [ ] Switch between branches in a Git project using Git CLI
- [ ] Stage changes using Git CLI
- [ ] Inspect the working directory and staging area using the Git CLI
- [ ] Commit staged changes using the Git CLI
```

## Setup

You'll need to work on this workshop in pairs.

- Assign one person to be **driver** (the driver will control the keyboard and do the typing)
- Assign another person to be **navigator** (the navigator will read out the questions and suggest how to tackle the problems)
- The **driver** will need to ensure they have a clone of this repo on their local machine **clone** this repository to their local machine.


## Task

In pairs, you will practice Git CLI commands to complete the tasks in this workshop.
After each commit, you should swap roles
