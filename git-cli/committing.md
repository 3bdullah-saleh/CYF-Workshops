# Committing changes

## Learning objectives

- [ ] commit changes in the staging area


First off, double check the state of your **Working Tree** and your **Staging Area**
You should do this in two ways: use the VSCode **interface** and the Command line **interface**

Now you can use [`git commit` command](https://www.w3schools.com/git/git_commit.asp?remote=github) to commit your changes.

Read the docs above to create a commit using the `git commit` command.


Now you need to check you successfully created a commit. Which command can you use to check this?


Once you've committed you can then repeat these steps to solve the other exercises.
