# Committing changes


ðŸŽ¯ Goal: commit changes in the staging area


First off, double check the state of your **Working Tree** and your **Staging Area**
You should do this in two ways: use the VSCode **interface** and the Command line **interface**

Now you can use [`git commit` command](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/git-commit) to commit your changes.

You can run the command `git commit -m YOUR_COMMIT_MESSAGE`
For example, `git commit -m "add solution for ex-1"`

Now you need to check you successfully created a commit. Which command can you use to check this?
