ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Checkout a new branch using the Git CLI

We need to create a **branch** so we can start making changes independently from `main`.
We can do this with the Git CLI. We'll need an appropriate branch name for the changes.

## Steps ðŸ‘£

1. Run the command `git branch --help` and briefly read the description. What happens if no `--list` option is given to the `git branch` command.

2. Now run the command `git branch` and double check your current branch.

3. Use the `git checkout` command to create a new branch. You can run `git checkout -b git-cli-workshop`

4. Now double check you're on a new branch.
