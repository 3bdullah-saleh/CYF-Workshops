# 🧠 Building a mental model 📚 🗣️

## Working directory ( aka Working tree 🌴 )

To develop your understanding of Git, you'll need to be able to build your **mental model** of how Git works.

One of these concepts is the **working directory** or **working tree**.


We make **changes** to our source code **in the working directory**.
We then **stage** our changes.
We then **commit** our **staged changes**.

So our first goal is:

🎯 Goal: Check to see what changes (if any) we have in our working directory.

## 👣 Steps

1. Go to the docs and check the definition of the `git status` command 👉 https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/inspecting-a-repository
1. Open the repo you cloned down during setup, and run the command `git status`
2. Discuss the log you get from running the command `git status`  - what do you think this tells you?
