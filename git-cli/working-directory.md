## Working Tree ðŸŒ´


The working tree is a key concept in Git.
It is the directory with the files and folders that we can view and edit.
When we're making changes to our code in VSCode, we're making changes in the working tree.

Let's remind ourselves about the commit workflow:

We make **changes** to our source code **in the working directory**.
We then **stage** our changes.
We then **commit** our **staged changes**.

So our first goal is:

ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Check to see what changes (if any) we have in our working directory.

To understand what is happening in this workshop, you will need to continually **check** the state of the **Working Tree** and the **Staging Area**.

So let's start with a check...

## ðŸ‘£ Steps

1. Run the command `git status --help` and check the name and description of this command (You can press `q` to quit)
2. Open the repo you cloned down during setup, and run the command `git status`
3. Discuss the log you get from running the command `git status` - what do you think this tells you at the moment?
