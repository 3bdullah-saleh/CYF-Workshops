# Why is typing important?
* Coding is a very brain-intensive activity
    * anything distracting your focus away from the code itself will ruin your **flow state** (https://lmgtfy.app/?q=flow+state)
    * To enter flow you need full focus i.e. no distractions. If you suddenly think "where is the U key?!" then you will never be in the zone.
    * Flow state is an amazing feeling - programming can be quite addictive when you enter it regularly!
* QWERTY is not the only layout
    * Common alternatives are Dvorak or Colemak
    * At work I personally go even further and use this crazy Ergodox keyboard (https://ergodox-ez.com/)
    * Do not feel forced to use your middle finger for the C key, I use my index finger but you should just do what comes naturally
